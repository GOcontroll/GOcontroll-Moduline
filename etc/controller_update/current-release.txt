0.3.13
fixed upload server so it no longer hangs on unknown files being sent.
Added read simulink signal and write simulink parameter to the nodered nodes. These can be used to communicate with a running simulink model directly instead of through files.
Added go-parse-a2l command, this parses the a2l file in /usr/simulink/ so it can be used by the new nodered nodes, and future applications involving direct memory reading/writing.
Bugfix on firmware of IR module. new version added to repositorie. For changes check IR repo.

new manual /etc/controller_update/manual_update.py script added, for manual updates without the app.
Bugfix on upload-new-module-firmware.js and module-info-gathering.js, these scripts now also toggle nodered and go-simulink if they are active.
these two services would claim modules in the controller which then would not be scanned by these programs.
Bugfix on gps.js node that converts GPS raw signal to longitude and latitude.
Added firmware file for IR model HW version 20300302
Updated the GPS node that is now compatible with the SIMCOM 7600G

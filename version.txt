8-12-2022 V1.9.25
Added read simulink signal and write simulink parameter to the nodered nodes. These can be used to communicate with a running simulink model directly instead of through files.
Added go-parse-a2l command, this parses the a2l file in /usr/simulink/ so it can be used by the new nodered nodes, and future applications involving direct memory reading/writing.
